Update the Book Catalog app with a book loan management system:

Add a button for switching out the content between the book listing and loan management system
the loan management system consists of a form for creating a book loan and, below the form, a list of loaned books
there should be a button to switch back to the book listing view
the form has three fields:
a text field for the borrower
a select field to choose the book being borrowed
a number field for the loan period (between 1 and 4 weeks)
when all books have been borrowed, the form should be replaced with a suitable message
a book cannot be loaned to more than 1 person, so the select field should only list books that are not on loan
in the loaned books section, indicate for each book the borrower's name, the loaned book's title and the due date
update the book component to indicate whether the book is on loan
